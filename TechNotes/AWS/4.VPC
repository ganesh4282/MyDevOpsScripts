Global Infrastructure :
**********************

Region : 
    Physical Location 
    26+ regions across the world
    Every region is connected via a high bandwidth fully redundant network
AZ     : 
    One or more Data Centers
    Each region contains two or more AZs
Local Zone:
    New type of infrastructure deployment that places AWS compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services in 
    large metropolitan areas closer to end users enabling access to single-digit millisecond latency 
    with the use of AWS Direct Connect and the ability to meet data residency requirements. 

    Local Zones are also connected to their parent Region via AWSâ€™s redundant and high bandwidth private network, 
    so applications running in Local Zones also have fast, secure, and seamless access to a complete list of services in the parent Region. 
Outposts:
    Pool of AWS compute and storage capacity deployed at a customer site.
    Fully managed solutions delivering AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises.
    Outposts lets you run some AWS services locally and connect to a broad range of services available in the local AWS Region.
Wavelength :
    Infrastructure offering optimized for mobile edge computing applications. 
    Application traffic from 5G devices reach application servers running in Wavelength Zones without leaving the telecommunications network.
CloudFront:
    CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.
    When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location 
    that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

    first four and last one are not available for use
    AWS recommands to use RFC1918 ranges.
